Revision history for Perl extension pler

1.06 Thu 10 Jun 2010
	- Apply rel2abs to the PERL5LIB additions so that path-changing
	  tests can still load modules properly.

1.05 Sun 24 Jan 2010
	- When executing the test script, enable RELEASE_TESTING

1.04 Wed 20 Jan 2010
	- Use a -I to PERL5LIB conversion trick similar to the it is done
	  by TAP::Parser::Source::Perl.
	- Add the inc directory to the -I list, as MakeMaker does.

1.03 Tue 19 Jan 2010
	- Removing the destructive Carp 0 dependency

1.02 Tue  5 Jan 2010
	- Make the integer shortcut more flexible, so it can handle
	  more than just an underscore after the numbers.

1.01 Sun  3 Jan 2010
	- Fixed a silly typo

1.00 Sun  3 Jan 2010
	- Switching to a production version
	- Upgraded to Module::Install::DSL 0.91
	- Added support for the xt directory
	- Added support for specialised integer filter
	- Added some actual tests for the filter logic

0.34 Mon 30 Jun 2008
	- Optimising file search to half the number of stat
	  calls that need to be made to the system.

0.33 Fri 18 Apr 2008
	- Enable HARNESS_ACTIVE when calling scripts

0.32 Tue  1 Jan 2008
	- Replacing the use of $^X with Probe::Perl

0.31 Thu 27 Sep 2007
	- Fixing multiple filters
	- Incrementing to get new author tests
	- Upgrading to Module::Install 0.68

0.30 Thu  6 Sep 2007
	- Adding support for multiple filters
	- Detect the distroot correctly from multiple
	  levels down subdirectories.

0.29 Fri 14 Sep 2007
	- Bug in multiple filters would cause an infinite loop, fixed
	- Fix a mistake in the version mismatch error message

0.28 Fri 14 Sep 2007
	- Added support for multiple filters, to make life easier in big test suites
	  (So stuff like "pler db 4" will match t/db-tests/04_foo.t but not t/04_static.t)
	- All pattern filters are now case-insensitive
	- Bug Fix: Stopped needlessly running ./Build every time
	  (A typo meant I was statting the wrong file in the shortcutting test)
	- Script now tests that it loads the module with matching version
	- Adding explicit dependencies for core modules (just in case)

0.27 Mon 27 Aug 2007
	- Added a first experimental attempt at Module::Build support

0.26 Mon 27 Aug 2007
	- Adding a -V option for the version
	- Adding a --help option for help/usage
	- Adding -w which will be passed through to the underlying perl call

0.25 Tue 21 Aug 2007
	- When inside the t directory and the user uses tab-completion to specify the
	  filename, call the file they meant even after we chdir up to the root.
	- If the root has a Makefile, but NOT a Makefile.PL, don't run it and risk
	  causing some unknown functionality to run.

0.24 Tue 21 Aug 2007
	- I am an idiot, and didn't actually USE the Cwd::chdir in the below release
	  (this fixes that)

0.23 Tue 21 Aug 2007
	- Use Cwd::chdir instead of the core chdir so that $ENV{PWD} is kept up to date
	  (This prevents pler breaking code which uses $ENV{PWD})
	- Adding a more recent dependency on 3.00 Pathtools to make sure we have Cwd

0.22 Tue 21 Aug 2007
	- If no Makefile.PL, intuit the dist root by looking for a "lib" and "t" dir

0.21 Mon 20 Aug 2007
	- dumb is spelled with a "b", not a "p". Oh the irony :(

0.20 Thu  2 Aug 2007
	- Moving bin/pler to the more standard script/pler
	- Collapse Devel::Pler into pler.pm
	- Adding support for regenerating the Makefile from Makefile.PL
	  (only on Win32, because the Makefile is not capable of regenerating)
	- Set TERM=dumb if no TERM value is set
	  (prevents a noisy error when the debugger starts up)

0.19 skipped

0.18 Wed 16 May 2007
        - Adding the ability to run scripts from the t directory
        - Moving pler.pm to Devel::Pler
        - Moving bin/pler to pler.pm
        - Added a stubbed launch script as bin/pler

0.17 Fri 11 May 2007
        - Fixing a path bug that breaks Test::Files
	- Updated Test::Script dependency to 1.02

0.16 Tue  2 Jan 2007
	- Fixed a test bug I thought I'd fixed already

0.15 Mon  1 Jan 2007
	- Converted from Devel::Pler to just pler.pm to allow
	  for better installation and documentation on search.cpan.
	- You can now "cpan -i pler"

0.14 Fri 15 Sep 2006
	- exec() does not work on Win32 (and we assume cygwin).
	  Instead, use system() which uses more memory, but
	  does at least work.

0.13 Thu  3 Aug 2006
	- Bug fixes
	  (I honestly don't know his this crap gets out to CPAN)

0.12 Thu 25 Jul 2006
	- Show the list of scripts with no params, or run script
	  if there is only one in the t directory.
	- When verbose is off, comment on the script name for clarity
	- Copying the POD in the Devel::Pler for better toolchain
	  compatibility.
