NAME
    pler - The DWIM Perl Debugger

DESCRIPTION
    pler is a small script which provides a sanity layer for debugging test
    scripts in Perl distributions.

    While prove has proven itself to be a highly useful program for manually
    running one or more groups of scripts in a distribution, what we also
    need is something that provides a similar level of intelligence in a
    debugging context.

    pler checks that the environment is sound, runs some cleanup tasks if
    needed, makes sure you are in the right directory, and then hands off to
    the perl debugger as normal.

TO DO
    - Tweak some small terminal related issues on Win32
